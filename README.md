## Installation Issues with React 19
If you encounter package installation issues due to React version conflicts (particularly with React 19), try installing packages with the --legacy-peer-deps flag:

`npm install package-name --legacy-peer-deps `


This flag tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts, which can occur when packages haven't yet been updated to support React 19's new peer dependency requirements.
